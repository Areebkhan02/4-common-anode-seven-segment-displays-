Build a system that is capable of driving 4 common anode seven
segment displays with multiplexed data lines, to display different numbers on the each sevensegment
LED display, we have to control the cathodes (YA-YG) of the four seven-segment
LEDs separately and by activating the four seven-segment LEDs at different times
